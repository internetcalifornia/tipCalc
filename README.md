**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Scott Eremia-Roden

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] send a text message of the split to each friend

## Notes

Some difficulties that I faced in during building this app:
    - How to model the data
    - How to best keep it as single responsibility of each object
    - Trying to learn new concepts and navigating Xcode
    - Images and layout are not my strongest area of experience so learning how to group buttons that make sense and using autolayout.
